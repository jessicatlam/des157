        <h3>#1: Instagram</h3>
        <h4>January 11, 2017</h4>
        <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/?hl=en"><img src="instagram.PNG" alt="Instagram photo"></a>Out of several social media platforms I use, Instagram is the only one that I try to check daily and thoroughly. It's a sleek application that enables users to share snippets of their own lives in the form of photos and videos with optional captions. Recently added features allow users to post photos and videos to a personal daily feed that expires after 24 hours, much like Snapchat. Users are also able to message other users privately, enabling Instagram to function as an even more robust tool that can foster community and interpersonal interactions. Unlike Facebook, the nature of the content itself is easily digestible, perfect for an increasingly busy society that seems to have less of an interest in lengthy articles and posts. The interface fades into the background of the experience; the sleek, minimal design uses simple icons to indicate other navigation options. Endless scrolling with only one full post visible at one time in the user's feed allows a lot of information to be displayed without being overwhelming. All of these aspects make Instagram a social media platform that is highly appealing to audiences who want to share and receive information quickly and simply while also interacting with their community. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/?hl=en">Check it out here!</a>
